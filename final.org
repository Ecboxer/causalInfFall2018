* format
** Optional conditioning, ie BDC
** 1 Which estimation method is appropriate, draw a graph for a system
** 1 Propensity score matching and WLS
** 2 Gen data and implement methods
** 3 Trickier implementations, choose one

* Instrum Var
** If correlation is small, can have large bias
   if instr is not strong enough
   because of denominator
   intuitive, instrument must have effect on causal state, strong -> determines causal state
   ie random state
** exc restr
   No causal rel between z and y, if delete z -> d no way for z to influence y
** estimators
   both measure late, exclude never and always-takers
   requires monotonicity, induces to either control or tr, if it can switch 0 -> 1 can't go rev
*** wald
*** tsls

* FDC
  2x bdc z|dox y|doz
  if x' cts, turns into integral, use binary/discrete if possible
** assumptions
*** intercepts all effect of x on y
*** no confounding btw x and z, pushes confounding ass from xy to xz, easier?
*** bdc 2x
** fda
   implement with disc !!!
   needs stoch in z !!!
*** optional separate tests, ie military svc
    use one var as a z do as nml
    use the other and do as normal
    both for full fdc

* Time series
** sing series
   can extraploate y0, w/o confounding
   MandW provide args for strengthening no confounding assumptions (see improvements)
** several units
   compare d0, d1
   optional hard prop score matching
   optional hard include other regression vars
** ANCOVA or Change Score
   change score for conditional est
   bdc on time series
   by regression inclusion
*** do change score simulation including time dependent confounding var

* improv
  note: there is an effect...
  for single time series
** application repeated, assuming stat like applying over several units, but across time slices
** shifts => how well can we determine the time series before treatment
